## Design, Development and Testing Log

![UI design version 1](images/ui_design1.png)
Brief UI design and how the system might work.

This is a sample design of my system as well as showing how it could work roughlt. I used this to talk to Mr. Copley if it is going to work and if the system meets all of the requirements. He said yes and noted that I should leave the last bit on the teacher's interface where he can edit the details until the very last and focus on making the other things perfect first. He also mentioned the portal log-in for the admin because he will be the only person who can add and make changes to the system.

Making and linking 2 tables for the database.

There are 2 tables for my database which are the project table and the student's table with the project id as a foreign key. This is just the first version of it. I will need to talk to my client to see if it needs to be alter or change.
