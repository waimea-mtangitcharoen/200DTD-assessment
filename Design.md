## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

The client whom I am currently working with is a teacher at Waimea college. He says that sometimes students, especially girls, walk in without any ideas for what to do for their technology's project. Same as Dtd, problems or ideas play a big role in the subject because we are trying to find ways to make our lives better. Therefore, I would like to create a storage system where students can browse through to get inspirational ideas.
