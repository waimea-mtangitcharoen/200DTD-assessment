Project Name: **Technology's project ideas**

Project Author: **Chittranuch Tangitcharoen**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

The client whom I am currently working with is a technology teacher at Waimea college. He says that sometimes students, especially girls, walk into the class without any ideas for what to do for their technology's project. Same as Dtd, problems or ideas play a big role in the subject because we are trying to find ways to make our lives better. Therefore, I would like to create a storage system where students can browse through to get inspirational ideas. 

### End-User Requirements
There are 2 types of main users that this system  is targeting:
- **Admin/My technology teacher**- He wants a place where he can store and put some ideas for a technology project for girls. Eventhough his IT skill is probably quite high level, the system should still be simple to use, easy and quick to add things on. He is likely to want the system's theme to be technology related as well.
- **Students**- Female students will be expecting to see a list of possible ideas for their technology projects that are not too difficult for them. Moreover, as they are girls, the ideas that are put in should be more related to girls. The system should be simple and easy to use because the students IT
